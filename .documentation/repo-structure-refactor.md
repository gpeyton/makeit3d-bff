# Repository Structure Refactor: Organizing 3D Sculpting Features

## Overview
Refactor the makeit3d-frontend to better organize the existing 3D sculpting features into a cleaner feature-based structure with shared infrastructure.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Feature-Based Architecture**
- **Sculpt-3D Module**: Reorganized existing 3D editor (`features/sculpt-3d/`)
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Common components, state, and utilities (`shared/`)

### 2. **File Organization Changes**
- **Minimal 3D Disruption**: Keep existing 3D filenames and move to `features/sculpt-3d/`
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Move common components to `shared/` directory
- **Configuration Consolidation**: Environment, constants, and config in `shared/config/`

## Target Project Structure

> **File Operation Legend:**
> - **`# KEEP SAME NAME`** = Move existing file to new location without renaming (stays JavaScript)
> - **`# NEW`** = Create new file that doesn't exist yet
> - **`# MOVE FROM [path]`** = File currently exists at specified path and will be relocated
> - **`# EXTRACT FROM [file]`** = Content extracted from existing file into new file

## Task List for Implementation

### ðŸ”„ Phase 1: Project Structure Setup
- [ ] Create new directory structure under `src/features/sculpt-3d/`
- [ ] Create new directory structure under `src/shared/`
- [ ] Move existing 3D components to new feature structure (keep all filenames)
- [ ] Move shared components to `shared/` directory
- [ ] Extract 3D-specific constants from `src/config/constants.js` into `features/sculpt-3d/constants/sculptTools.js`
- [ ] Extract general app constants from `src/config/constants.js` into `shared/constants/appConstants.js`
- [ ] Update import paths in moved files

### ðŸ§ª Phase 2: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Verify 3D editor still works after refactoring
- [ ] Test all existing 3D functionality
- [ ] Update any broken import paths
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (iOS/Android)

### Integration Notes
- **Preserve Existing**: All current 3D editor functionality moves to `src/features/sculpt-3d/` unchanged
- **No Content Changes**: State slices (`editorSlice.js`, `modelSlice.js`) move locations but content stays identical
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Common components, hooks, and utilities centralized in `shared/` directory
- **Import Path Updates**: Only change import statements to reflect new file locations
