## Implementation Status âœ…

### Database Schema (Implemented)
- âœ… `user_credits` table with balance and subscription tracking
- âœ… `credit_transactions` table for audit trail
- âœ… `operation_costs` table for configurable pricing
- âœ… All indexes and relationships configured
- âœ… Pre-populated with current operation costs

### BFF Integration (Implemented)
- âœ… Credit management functions in `supabase_handler.py`
- âœ… Automatic user initialization with 30 free credits
- âœ… Credit checking and deduction before API calls
- âœ… Transaction logging for audit and analytics
- âœ… Credit history retrieval for user dashboard

### API Integration Pattern

```python
# Before making any AI API call:
credit_result = await check_and_deduct_credits(
    user_id=user_id,
    operation_key="text_to_image_stability_core",
    task_id=task_id
)

# Proceed with AI API call only if credits were successfully deducted
if credit_result["success"]:
    # Make AI API call
    result = await ai_provider.generate_image(...)
```

### Operation Keys Reference

| Operation Key | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `text_to_image_core` | Core text-to-image generation |
| `text_to_image_ultra` | Ultra quality text-to-image generation |
| `text_to_image_v3` | V3 text-to-image generation |
| `text_to_image_v2` | V2 text-to-image generation |
| `image_to_image` | Image-to-image transformation |
| `remove_background` | Background removal service |
| `search_recolor` | Search and recolor functionality |
| `image_to_3d` | 3D model generation |

### Next Steps (Not Implemented Yet)

- [ ] Update existing AI endpoints to use credit system
- [ ] Add subscription management endpoints
- [ ] Add credit purchase/payment integration
- [ ] Frontend credit display and management UI
- [ ] Admin dashboard for cost monitoring

## ðŸ”’ CONFIDENTIAL: Complete Operation Details (Temporarily Hidden from Consultant)

**Note**: The 3D generation operations, Tripo provider details, and all real provider names (Stability, Recraft) have been temporarily obfuscated in the database `operation_costs` table. The consultant will only see generic "provider_a" and "provider_b" names. The complete details are preserved here for later restoration.
