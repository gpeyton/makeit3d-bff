# Mesh Editing Mobile App Prototype - Architecture Brief

## 1. Overview

This project is to develop a **Putty 3D clone**â€”a mobile application for iOS and Android that allows users to import, sculpt, and export 3D models. The focus is on providing a core set of intuitive mesh sculpting tools with a responsive user experience, inspired by the usability of Putty3D.

## 2. Core Prototype Features

*   **Model Import**: Users can import 3D models in `.glb` format from their device.
*   **3D Viewport**: Display and navigate (rotate, pan, zoom) the imported 3D model.
*   **Sculpting System**:
    *   **Tools**:
        *   **Add/Draw Tool**: Increases volume by adding material, allowing users to build up forms.
        *   **Subtract Tool**: Removes material, useful for carving into the model (can be a mode of the Add/Draw tool or a separate tool).
        *   **Smooth Tool**: Softens transitions and blends areas for a polished look.
        *   **Flatten Tool**: Levels surfaces, aiding in creating planes or hard edges.
        *   **Move Tool**: Adjusts the mesh by pulling or pushing areas to reshape the model.
    *   **Brush Settings**: Adjustable brush size and strength for all applicable tools.
    *   **Mirror Mode**: Enables symmetrical sculpting, reflecting changes across a user-selectable axis (e.g., X, Y, or Z).
*   **Local Project Save/Load**: Save the current state of the edited model (geometry) locally on the device and reload it.
*   **Model Export**: Export the edited model as a `.glb` file, including sculpted geometry.
*   **Undo/Redo**: Basic undo/redo functionality for sculpt actions.

## 3. Technical Stack Overview

*   **Mobile Frontend**: React Native with Expo (TypeScript recommended).
    *   3D Rendering: `react-three-fiber` with `expo-gl`.
    *   State management solution (e.g., Zustand, Redux Toolkit, or React Context).

## 4. Scope of Work

The mobile application will provide the user interface and interactive tools for sculpting.

### Core Responsibilities:

1.  **User Interface (UI)**:
    *   Screen for importing models.
    *   Main editor screen with 3D viewport, toolbars for sculpting (reflecting the Add/Draw, Subtract, Smooth, Flatten, Move tools), and brush settings panels.
    *   UI control for toggling Mirror Mode and selecting the symmetry axis.
    *   File management UI for local save/load.
2.  **3D Viewport & Interaction**:
    *   Render `.glb` models using `react-three-fiber` and `expo-gl`.
    *   Implement camera controls (orbit, pan, zoom).
    *   Visually represent sculpting brush on the model surface, including a visual indicator for the symmetry plane if Mirror Mode is active.
3.  **Tool Logic (Client-Side)**:
    *   Manage active tool, brush settings.
    *   Implement client-side interaction logic for all sculpting tools. This includes applying deformations symmetrically if Mirror Mode is enabled.
    *   Manage undo/redo stack for local actions.
4.  **File Handling**:
    *   Import `.glb` files from device storage.
    *   Save current project state (including modified mesh) locally.
    *   Export final edited model as a `.glb` file to device storage.

## 5. Key Requirements & Considerations

*   **File Format**: `.glb` is the exclusive format for model import, export, and local save/load.
*   **User Experience**: The primary goal is a smooth and interactive experience for the sculpting tools. Minimize perceived latency.
*   **Performance**: The client-side rendering and tool interaction must be performant on target mobile devices.
*   **Modularity**: Aim for modular code to facilitate maintenance and potential future enhancements.
